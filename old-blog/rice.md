# Ricing out every application on my computer

I really enjoy making the applications on my computer look cool, and I thought I'd share some of the ways I customize stuff.


## VSCode
- [background-cover](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=manasxx.background-cover) extension to give myself an image in the background
- [Custom CSS and JS extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) that loads a custom stylesheet to give myself box shadow on the terminal pane and a rainbow animated status bar: https://github.com/EricPedley/dotfiles/blob/main/.vscode/custom.css
- [Activistatus bar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.activitusbar) extension to put the editor, search, and source control buttons in the status bar so I can hide the status bar on the side.

## Discord
- BetterDiscord + ClearVision theme

## Spotify
- Spicetify

## Terminal
- powerline
- in Windows terminal, you can set a background image.

## Chrome / Firefox
- Dark Reader extension
- Custom stylesheet that hides the address bar when it isn't focused: https://superuser.com/a/1269912
