# Portfolio Website
## Description
 A website to display all my projects. Updating it is really convenient because it loads all the content (title, demo link, image, description) dynamically from the README of each project. Every time I want to add a new one, I just format the README correctly and add the repo link to one of the files in this project.
 
 I used this package for the interesting 3d effects on the cards: https://github.com/micku7zu/vanilla-tilt.js
