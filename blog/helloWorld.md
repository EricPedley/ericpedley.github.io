# Hello, World!

This is going to be like an intro post where I explain my motivation behind starting a blog and what my plans for it are.

I've found that writing can be a really good way to get stuff out of your head, which leaves more room for the important things in the moment. It's like moving data from RAM to hard disk. I usuall keep a personal journal but I feel like I have some pretty neat tidbits that a younger version of myself would've benefitted from reading, which is why I'm writing a public blog instead of just journal entries.
