# Eric's Reading List

This doesn't really make sense as an article with a date, so I might figure out how to move it around in the future. Anyways, the *Intentionally Making Close Friends* article struck me as so good that I needed to save it somewhere permanent, and made me realize I should've been doing this for a while since I vaguely remember a lot of moments in the past year where I read something and it was at least somewhat life-changing, and I forget a lot of them. Probably one of the best changes I've made to my life is replacing doomscrolling on Reddit with doomscrolling on Hacker News, which changed the hit rate for actually useful articles from like 0% to 5%.
